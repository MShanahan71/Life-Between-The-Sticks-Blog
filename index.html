<h1>A Goalkeeper’s View of the Beautiful Game</h1>

<h2>Welcome to Life Between the Sticks — where football is seen from the mud-streaked gloves, behind the back line, and through the eyes of the one position nobody truly understands until they’ve lived it.

This isn’t just match reports or coaching drills. It’s real talk from the 6-yard box: part blog, part battle diary, part comedy therapy. 

Expect hard truths, honest reflections, and stories that could only come from the loneliest, loudest, and most misunderstood spot on the pitch. 

Whether you’re a keeper, a coach, a parent on the sidelines, or just someone who loves the game — you’re in the right place.
